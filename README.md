# CineRank ‚Äì Modern Movies & People Discovery Platform

A modern React + Tailwind application for discovering movies, TV series, and popular celebrities (people) using real data from The Movie Database (TMDB). The platform now emphasizes rich browsing, people exploration, progressive content reveal sections, and a refined glassmorphic UI.

## üéØ Key Concepts & Components

### API & Data
- **movieService**: Consolidates fetch logic for movies, TV, trending, upcoming, people & person details
- **Stable IDs**: Transformer adds `tmdbId` to ensure consistent routing and key usage
- **Combined Credits**: Person detail page uses merged credits to power "Known For" section

### State Management
- **MovieContext**: Extended to include `popularPeople`, `personDetails`, plus existing movie & TV slices
- **Local Storage Hook**: Ready for persisting ratings/user preferences
- **Composable Filters**: Dynamic genre & language lists populated from API

### Routing & Navigation
- **Routes Added**: `/people`, `/person/:id`, `/tv-series`, `/top-rated`, `/new-releases`
- **Removed From Nav**: Legacy `/reviews` link (code retained for future iteration)
- **Deep Linking**: Stable detail page URLs using TMDB IDs

### User-Facing Features
- **Weekly Picks**: Curated section revealed row-by-row (5 items per expansion)
- **Popular Celebs**: Circular avatar grid with +5 reveal increments after first 10
- **Advanced Filters**: Multi-genre, language, year, and rating range (popover UI)
- **Glass UI Buttons**: `LiquidButton` variants (primary / ghost) unify CTAs
- **Movie & Person Detail**: Rich meta sections (biography, departments, known for)

## üé® Styling & Design

### Tailwind CSS Integration

### User Experience & UI
